* Teamwork & collaboration
* Staffing adequacy & workload
* Inter-department coordination
* Shift handovers
* Safety culture & blame climate
* Unit-level operational support

Objectives of the Study

The analysis aims to answer:

How do staff across different hospitals perceive patient safety?

What are the common views on teamwork, staffing, shift handovers, and safety climate?

Which departments contributed insights, and where are the data gaps?

What strengths and improvement areas can hospital leadership act on?

The analysis includes:

* 🔍 **Frequency counts and distributions** (Hospital, Staff Role, Work Unit)
* 📊 **Likert scale summarization** (Mean, Median, Agreement Percentages)
* 📈 **Visualization of safety culture indicators**
* 📚 **Interpretation and insight generation**
* 🧽 **Full data-cleaning workflow**

The findings offer **evidence-based insights** that can support:

* Hospital quality improvement initiatives
* Staff training and development programs
* County-level healthcare policy and resource decisions

All analysis was performed in Python using:

* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn**
